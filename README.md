# Algorithms Collection

This repository is a personal project created for fun, where I explore and implement various algorithms in multiple programming languages. The goal is to document and practice algorithms, ranging from basic sorting to more complex data structures and problem-solving techniques.

I plan to continually add new algorithms and experiment with different languages to improve my understanding of algorithmic concepts and their applications. Feel free to explore and contribute!

## Currently Supported Languages:

- Python
- JavaScript
- TypeScript

Stay tuned for more languages and algorithms!

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute, feel free to fork the repository, create a branch, and submit a pull request with new algorithms or improvements. Any suggestions are always welcome!
